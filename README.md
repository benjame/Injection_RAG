# Injection_RAG

Injection_RAG is an innovative natural language processing project that combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology with prompt injection techniques to enhance the performance and controllability of large language models.

Key features:

- Utilizes RAG technology to retrieve relevant information from external knowledge bases
- Optimizes model output through prompt injection
- Improves the accuracy and relevance of model responses
- Flexibly adapts to different domains and task requirements

This project is suitable for various applications requiring high-quality, controllable text generation, such as question-answering systems, chatbots, and content generation.
